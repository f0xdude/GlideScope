An app to measure glide ratio from phone's angle to a point on screen.

Useful for speedflying and wingsuit base jumping. Used to measure the glide ratio required to a certain object.

How to use:

Stand on the exit point or takeoff.
Start the App and point the crosshair to the landing zone.
GlideScope will calculate the glide ratio from the angle to the landing.
Important: Stay still when taking a measurement, moving the phone will affect accuracy and increase error. If you can't see the landing field, measure the glide to the highest point in your flight path. Take muptiple measurements and compare results. !!! Do not base life and health depending decisions on the data from the app. It uses your phone sensors and may give incorrect readings. Glide ratio is an ever changing variable in the real world. Fly safe.
